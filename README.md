# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML-with-Web-base-Application
This is my final year capstone project, titled "Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning with Web-based Application." The system is designed to predict whether a patient may have diabetes using a machine-learning model and a web-based interface.


#Content
Diabetes Prediction System Report.pdf – A detailed report explaining the project’s objectives, methodologies, and results.
DiabetesPrediction.rar – A compressed file containing all project resources, including images, source code, and related files.
Diagon_Alley.pptx – The presentation slides used to showcase the project's features and outcomes.
diabetes.csv – The dataset file used for training the machine learning model is sourced from Kaggle's PIMA Indian dataset.

This project combines the power of machine learning with a user-friendly web-based application to provide valuable insights into diabetes prediction.
